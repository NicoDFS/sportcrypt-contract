Optimization

* uint8 v value (really 1 bit) in trade method takes up 32 bytes, maybe overload amount?
* no hard-coded batch sizes in checkMatchBatch/checkOrderBatch
* in checkOrderBatch, expose if orders are completely filled so they can be removed by web app


Interface

? method to deposit and trade in same transaction
? method to claim and withdraw in same transaction
? expiry timestamp on trades as well as orders (maybe overload amount?)


Model

* prevent very small trades (ie 1 wei) since they can happen when balance got maxed out
? more granular prices (1-1000 maybe)


Misc

* use recent improvements in solidity language
  * emit for events
  * textual error messages in require
  * mod code to avoid deprecation warnings
* test performance
  * i think it's using pure-JS keccak function?
