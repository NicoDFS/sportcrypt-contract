Optimization

* uint8 v value (really 1 bit) in trade method takes up 32 bytes, maybe overload amount?
* no hard-coded batch sizes in checkMatchBatch/checkOrderBatch


Interface

? method to deposit and trade in same transaction


Model

? more granular prices (1-1000 maybe)

Misc

* use recent improvements in solidity language
  * emit
  * textual error messages in require
